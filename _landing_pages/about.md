**{static is} The New Dynamic** began in 2014 by Bud Parr to help fellow front-end developers and designers utilize static web technology in their work. The purpose of this site is to promote the use of static site generators for people who build websites.

The site will be editorially driven; that is, it will not attempt to be comprehensive, just, hopefully, interesting and we welcome contributions from the community.

While we may recommend commercial as well as open source projects on this site, we do not accept freebies that are not available to the general public and will disclose any interests when appropriate.
