We were really sure about using a static website, because 99% of the content wasn&acute;t going to change. The site is changing constantly, because journalists are continually adding articles and posts, but those posts are mainly plain text. The only dynamic part (the reading list) was implemented using JSON, Javascript and the browser local storage.

And about Jekyll, we really love Jekyll, because it's simple enough to start a project really fast, but the plugin system gives you a lot of flexibility, to do really custom and sophisticated things. Also, the community is great, you find really good examples and blog posts.
