When working on a new language, framework, or toolset, we’re often working with an example that wants us to build a blog. While blogs are great and easy to build, they are a limited in scope, and it could be we’re looking to build a different sort of static site—one that isn’t a collection of posts arranged by date. So what's the alternative?

Enter Middleman. Middleman is a framework built for the purpose of creating simple static sites. Think of it as Jekyll, but for everything that isn’t a blog. And in this post, we’ll look at creating a simple static site with Middleman.
