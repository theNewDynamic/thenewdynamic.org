Jekyll is a tool that builds fast, simple, secure websites. It is an alternative to a conventional content management system (CMS). The key difference between Jekyll and most CMS software is that Jekyll has no database and is made of plain text and HTML files. Fundamentally, it is a publishing system that generates HTML markup from plain text Markdown files.
