I put this calendar together for a client site, so my initial goal was to make it functional. At this point, it's usable but could use some work, so feel free to contribute or leave an issue.


- add _data folder and the events.yaml file with sample data
- add [calendar.json](http://localhost:4000/calendar.json) to generate a JSON file
- add calendar.js to includes folder
- include jquery/underscore/moment.js in the footer
- include calendar.js in the footer below the others.
- add the tags below wherever you want your events to show up.

<strong>Upcoming Events</strong>
```<div id="calendar"></div>```


<strong>Past Events</strong>
```<div id="calendar-past"></div>```
