Short notice on this talk, but we're delighted to have Brian Rinaldi speak. Brian is the author of O'Reilly's "Working with Static Sites."

This talk is perfect if you've been thinking about making the leap to static. Details below.

Perhaps you're intrigued by static sites but can't imagine going through the manual labor of extracting your current content into a new tool. Well - good news - most static site generators have some sort of migration tools to help with this process. Sure, there's still a lot of heavy lifting involved, but these tools will help you get ahead with nominal effort.

In this talk, we'll look at some of the tools available from some of the major static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo and others. We'll even explore how to use some of these to migrate a Wordpress site to a static solution. Finally, we'll look at additional options that assist in the migration from other CMS like Drupal, Joomla and more.
