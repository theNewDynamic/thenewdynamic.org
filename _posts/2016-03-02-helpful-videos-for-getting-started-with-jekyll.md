Helpful Videos for Getting Started with Jekyll

When I started learning Jekyll I found [Thomas Bradley's](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/topics/jekyll/) series of [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWjCJDeWfDdfVEcLGAfdJn_HXyM4Y7_k-) helpful (and now I see there's also a series of [companion tutorials](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/topics/jekyll/)). I also deconstructed some of Michael Rose's [themes](https://mademistakes.com/work/jekyll-themes/) and generally tried to push the Liquid templating language as far as I could.

The guys at [Cloudcanon](http://cloudcannon.com/) (the "CMS for Jekyll") have created an entire site of jekyll tips, tutorials and code, now including a series of videos. The first videos cover the topics of "Collections" and "Front Matter." View them here: [http://jekyll.tips/jekyll-casts/](http://jekyll.tips/jekyll-casts/).
