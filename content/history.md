[Civic Hall emerged](http://www.gothamgazette.com/index.php/government/5519-in-new-civic-tech-hub-a-family-legacy-of-community-building-continues) from the connections that evolved over the first ten years of the [**Personal Democracy Forum**](http://go.personaldemocracy.com/) conference,
run by [Personal Democracy Media](https://personaldemocracy.com/about-us).

**In late 2013 and early 2014**, Personal Democracy Media (PDM) **interviewed more than 100 civic innovators,** technologists, government officials, journalists, philanthropists and investors one-on-one to identify the needs of the civic innovation community. **The results lead to the following conclusions:**

*   Civic technology crosses sectors that do not share physical space.
*   The civic innovation community longs for a place to come together 365 days a year that is more sustainable and impactful than a hackathon, and more open and less structured than a startup incubator.
*   There is a consistent interest in curated workshops and events focused on civic innovation, in addition to daily networking opportunities.

**After opening our doors in February 2015**, our community has grown to more than 850 technologists, social entrepreneurs, government officials, philanthropy professionals, journalists, activists and change-makers.
