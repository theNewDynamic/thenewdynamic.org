Our Slack network is an excellent platform to communicate and stay in touch with all of your fellow Civic Hall members. In the [**Civic Hall Slack Team**](https://civichallmembers.slack.com/) we post events outside Civic Hall, share exciting member news, and more.

Shortly after your membership was approved, you should have received an email with an invitation to join the Slack channel. Create your login and you’re in. If you never received the invite, check your spam folder. If you still can not find it, email community@civichall.org and we will resend your invitation. Please make sure to provide an active email address.
