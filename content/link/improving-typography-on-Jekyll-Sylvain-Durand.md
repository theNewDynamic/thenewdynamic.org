Observing typographical rules on the Internet is not always easy: although Unicode reserves many areas of characters for typographic symbols, many punctuation marks and spaces are most of the time unused.

With Jekyll, the articles are written very simply with Markdown before being generated in HTML by the engine: we can add automatic rules to improve typography on our site without carrying about it when writing articles.
