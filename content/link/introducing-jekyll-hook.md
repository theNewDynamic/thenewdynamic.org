For those cases where we need the simplicity of GitHub Pages’ workflow but have to host on our own infrastructure, we built Jekyll-hook. It’s an extensible server that builds Jekyll sites on each commit to a GitHub repository, just like GitHub Pages. It provides a ton of additional flexibility, while preserving the benefits of static site generation, like needing no server-side processing to serve webpages.
