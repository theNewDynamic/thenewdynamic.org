> I'll be soon embarking on a long bike tour and was searching for a way to keep a journal of my trip but also post updates to a website. Day One was an obvious journaling choice, but with version 2, publishing isn't yet available. With a little poking around, it turned out to be fairly easy to export Day One entries and publish to Pelican (my static blog generator of choice).
