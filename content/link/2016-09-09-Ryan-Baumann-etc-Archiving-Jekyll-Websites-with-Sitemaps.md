If you run a Jekyll blog (like this one!), you might be interested in having your blog posts saved in a web archive like the Internet Archive Wayback Machine. In this post, I’ll show you how you can use an auto-generated sitemap to get a list of all URLs on your Jekyll blog, then feed those URLs to a web archiving process.
