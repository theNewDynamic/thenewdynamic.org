As a collaboration center, we will often have activities and events happening in the space.
All members are welcome to attend events that are listed with details.

Civic Hall can also be reserved for [PRIVATE] meetings and events. These are listed here so we can all be aware ahead of time on what areas of the space will be in use.

Some events will require the community workspace to be cleared starting at 5:00pm. Please refer to this calendar for information on when and where these events will be happening. Keep your eyes open for signage!
