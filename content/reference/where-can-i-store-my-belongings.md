Civic Hall is not responsible for lost or stolen items in any of our spaces. That being said, we do have spaces for you to keep your belongings while you use the space.

**COAT ROOM**: Members and their guests are welcome to use the coat room in front of the Welcome Desk for coats and weather accessories. Bags and luggage must be checked in at the Welcome Desk. Do not leave items in coat room overnight.

**LOCKERS**: If you want a locker with a key please email the Welcome Desk Team at welcome@civichall.org and we will help get that set-up for you. The current rate for a locker is $50/month.
