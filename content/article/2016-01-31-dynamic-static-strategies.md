A(nother!) talk by Phil Hawks­worth:

From the talk description:

> Are we over-engineering? What is the real effort in developing, hosting and maintaining sites which have many moving parts? The cost of serving static sites has never been lower. And front-end development practices have never been richer. Couldn't we harness this better and make life simpler without dumbing down?

> In this talk we'll explore some unexpected capabilities and characteristics of "static" sites. We'll look at ways to use emerging tools and services to create robust, high performance websites which can be more dynamic than some of their heavier and more costly brothers and sisters.
