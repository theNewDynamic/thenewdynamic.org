**June 20th at 12pm EST**

Developers today have the blessing and the curse of a plethora of tools. On the one hand, we have pretty much all of our bases covered - often for free. On the other, it can be tough to keep pace with all the tools and what they are good for.

In this month’s meetup, we’ll explore a couple of these tools and get to know them. First, Chris Coyier will go through [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) and how to take advantage of this social development environment for front-end designers and developers. Then Shannon Soper will explore [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), a blazing-fast static site generator for React.
