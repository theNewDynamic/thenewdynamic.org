Thoughtworks, the San Francisco-based software development firm, has included static site generators on their "Technology Radar" for 2015, saying that:

> Static site generators like Middleman or Jekyll have become popular for creating simple websites or blogs, but we are increasingly seeing their use as part of more complex application stacks. The default assumption that all content delivered over HTTP has to be dynamically created on request is shifting, with more teams looking to use static pre-generated content."
