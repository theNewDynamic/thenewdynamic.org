The long awaited [Jekyll 3.0](http://jekyllrb.com/news/2015/10/26/jekyll-3-0-released/) was just released. With new features like incremental regeneration, Hook Plugin API, and the Liquid Profiler, Jekyll is poised to be used on larger, more complicated sites.

Here's a video from the [Static Web-tech Meetup](http://www.staticwebtech.com/presentations/launching-jekyll-3.0/) for the Jekyll launch on October, 26th.
