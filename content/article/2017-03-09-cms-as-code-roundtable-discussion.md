## CMS as Code

In "Infrastructure as Code: From the Iron Age to the Cloud Age" Kief Morris describes the "Iron Age" as a time when "infrastructure growth was limited by the hardware purchasing cycle. Since it could take weeks for a new server to arrive, there was little pressure to rapidly install and configure an operating system on it."


But now, in the "Cloud Age", systems are deployed using cloud services. Many of these services, including Contentful, provide friendly UIs where users can configure environments. Unfortunately, as the number of services that teams operate grows, it becomes unmanageable to maintain each one by pointing and clicking through the UI. "Infrastructure as Code" is an approach to deal with this issue: configuration of each service is automated, and the configuration is stored along with the source code for the application in version control. An API-first, headless CMS makes it possible to treat your CMS as code.
