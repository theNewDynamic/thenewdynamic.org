Our first session:  
  
An Introduction to GraphQL  
  
GraphQL has taken the API world by storm! If you've been RESTing on your laurels we'll get you up to speed with an introduction to GraphQL and some helpful tips to remember when you build out your first GraphQL API.  
  
Our second session:  
  
TakeShape  
  
GraphQL+CMS = Peanut Butter+Jelly - Follow along to a live coding introduction to TakeShape, a new headless GraphQL CMS that champions the JAMstack with a focus on developer productivity. We'll show you why pairing a GraphQL API with a static site CMS makes the JAMstack even more delicious  
  
Presenter Biographies  
  
Mark and Andrew are the Co-founders of TakeShpe. They met 15 years ago in the Computer Science department at Northeastern University. And they were on the engineering teams behind big content sites like Newsweek, The Daily Beast, and Fast Company magazines.  
Andrew  
  
Andrew started his career in enterprise search and natural language processing at Autonomy, acquired by HP. After that, he moved into media where he led the engineering team at Newsweek and The Daily Beast. Prior to TakeShape he was CTO and Co-Founder of a startup called Fairtread where he helped creators monetize their digital content.  
  
Mark  
  
For the past 7 years, Mark was the managing director of Ronik, an award-winning creative agency in Brooklyn. He’s had to solve content management conundrums for clients, building everything from traditional media sites to interactive experiences and marketing platforms.  
  
Together Andrew and Mark have directly experienced just about every problem you can encounter with content management and they’ve been obsessed with finding better ways to deliver and render content on the web.
