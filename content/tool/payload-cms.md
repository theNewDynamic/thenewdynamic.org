Out of the box, Payload gives you a lot of the things that you often need when developing a new website, web app, or native app:

* A Mongo database to store your data
* A way to store, retrieve, and manipulate data of any shape via full REST and GraphQL APIs
* Authentication—complete with commonly required functionality like registration, email verification, login, & password reset
* Deep access control to your data, based on document or field-level functions
* File storage and access control
* A beautiful admin UI that’s generated specifically to suit your data
