description: 'In the "Cloud Age", systems are deployed using cloud services. Many
  of these services, including Contentful, provide friendly UIs where users can configure
  environments. Unfortunately, as the number of services that teams operate grows,
  it becomes unmanageable to maintain each one by pointing and clicking through the
  UI. "Infrastructure as Code" is an approach to deal with this issue: configuration
  of each service is automated, and the configuration is stored along with the source
  code for the application in version control. An API-first, headless CMS makes it
  possible to treat your CMS as code.'
